# AlertControl

AlertControl is a utility created to easily enable or disable alerting by service or customer.

Components:
1. SharePoint List containing the name of each service, on/off column, along with a logo
2. As part of our Master Client List, a column for each service.  This enables turning individual alerts on/off for each customer
3. PowerApp to actually control all this
